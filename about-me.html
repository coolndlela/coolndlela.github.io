		Given the opportunity, I can show myself better than I can explain in words. I have been part of a team 
		that as a result of my contribution has been ran close to flawless. There are times when my team had no 
		manager, and it ran way better than teams that have managers. I am dependable, During covid 19, there 
		are times when my colleagues got ill, and I was able to run the department alone without any issues, not 
		just once. I am creative, positive, and always look for ways to do things better. I have more experience 
		working as part of a team than individually. I am curious, energetic, and always learning, and willing to
		learn.
