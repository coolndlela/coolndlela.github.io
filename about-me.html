	<p><h3>Given the opportunity, I can show myself better than I can explain in words. I have been part of a team that as
	a result of my contribution has been ran close to flawless. There are times when my team had no manager, and it ran 
	way better than teams that have managers. I am dependable, During covid 19, there are times when my colleagues got ill, 
	and I was able to run the department alone without any issues, not just once. I am creative, positive, and always look 
	for ways to do things better. I have more experience working as part of a team than individually. I am curious, energetic,
	and always learning, and willing to learn.</h3><p>
